- **Dataset Name**: Global_Power_Plant.csv
- **Source**: The dataset contains information on power plants across **164 countries**, representing about **80% of the worldâ€™s power generation capacity**.
- **Fields**: Includes plant type (**thermal** or **renewable**), location, capacity, generation output, ownership structure, and fuel type.
- **Additional Metadata**: Dataset metadata is available in **Global_Power_Plant_Metadata.txt**.

## **Requirements**
- **Python 3.10+**: The code is compatible with Python 3.10 or higher.

### **Libraries**:
- **pandas**
- **matplotlib**
- **seaborn**
- **numpy**
